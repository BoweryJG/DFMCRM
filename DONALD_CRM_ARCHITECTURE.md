# Donald Mammano's Property CRM Architecture

This document outlines a high‑level architecture and feature set for an AI‑assisted Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform tailored for **Donald Mammano**, owner of DFM Properties in Scranton, Pennsylvania. The goal is an intuitive, distraction‑free system that can be operated with minimal daily input.

## Design Principles
- **Zero Clutter:** Large icons, simplified layout, and a touch‑friendly dashboard. Voice guidance and minimal text for easy navigation.
- **Rapid Input:** Voice commands and quick‑add buttons for common tasks (maintenance, notes, contacts).
- **Visual Organization:** Scrollable map showing each property with embedded cards for occupancy, rent status, and alerts.
- **Automation:** Automated reminders for leases, rent, inspections, and taxes with snooze capability.
- **Offline Ready:** Mobile version optimized for low signal, quick load times, and offline data capture.

## Key Features
1. **Property & Portfolio View**
   - Interactive map of all properties with color‑coded markers (vacant, occupied, maintenance required).
   - Tap a marker to open a card with occupancy, maintenance issues, and rent status.
   - Filter by property type or urgency.

2. **Tenant Tracking**
   - Per‑unit tenant profiles showing lease dates, contact information, payment status, and communication history.
   - One‑touch options to call, text, or email from any tenant card.
   - Preconfigured onboarding: auto‑generate lease templates and store signed copies in the tenant profile.

3. **Maintenance Management**
   - Voice input to log maintenance issues ("Replace roof at 123 Main Street").
   - Urgency flags (green/yellow/red) to prioritize repairs.
   - Automatic follow‑up reminders until the task is resolved.

4. **Financial Dashboard**
   - At‑a‑glance summary of rents collected, outstanding balances, and expenses.
   - Breakdowns by property, by portfolio, and in total.
   - Export data for accounting or tax reporting.

5. **Notes & Media Uploads**
   - Voice‑to‑text for quick notes.
   - Photo or image upload (handwritten notes, inspection pictures) directly into each property or unit profile.

6. **Automated Reminders**
   - Lease renewals, inspections, rent due dates, and annual taxes.
   - Snooze options to delay notifications when needed.

7. **Truck‑Friendly Mobile Mode**
   - Simplified menu with large buttons and offline caching.
   - Minimal graphics for faster loading in low‑reception areas.
   - Quick access to recent tasks and urgent alerts.

## System Components
- **Front‑End UI**: Built with a modern, responsive framework (React or Flutter) to support touch interfaces and voice interaction. A map library (Mapbox/Leaflet) displays property locations.
- **Back‑End Services**: REST/GraphQL API built with Node.js or Python (FastAPI/Django) for data management. Authentication and user permissions included.
- **Database**: Cloud‑hosted (PostgreSQL or MongoDB) storing properties, tenants, leases, and maintenance records. Caching layer for mobile offline support.
- **Voice Processing**: Integration with on‑device speech recognition (mobile) or a cloud service (e.g., Azure Speech) for transcription.
- **Automation Engine**: Scheduled jobs for reminders, follow‑up notifications, and lease generation.
- **File Storage**: Cloud storage (S3‑compatible) for images, scanned documents, and audio notes.

## Daily Workflow (Under 15 Minutes)
1. **Morning Dashboard Check (5 minutes)**
   - Open the map view on tablet or phone.
   - Review color‑coded alerts (maintenance, rent overdue, upcoming lease expirations).
   - Voice‑record any quick notes from site visits.
2. **Tenant Communications (5 minutes)**
   - Use one‑touch call/text/email from tenant cards for follow‑ups.
   - Review automatic reminders or flagged communications.
3. **Maintenance Follow‑Up (5 minutes)**
   - Check open work orders and mark them complete or snooze reminders.
   - Schedule contractors or vendors if needed.

## Emotional & Visual Approach
- Calm, muted color scheme (soft blues and greens) to reduce stress.
- Large, legible fonts with plenty of spacing.
- Dashboard organized like a whiteboard: drag‑and‑drop elements, simple checklists, and voice hints for new users.

## Extensibility
- API endpoints for future integrations (accounting software, smart sensors, or tenant portals).
- Modular design allows adding features such as AI‑powered rent analysis or automated compliance reports.

## Conclusion
This architecture enables Donald to manage his 200+ tenants with minimal daily effort. The system is intentionally simple yet powerful, emphasizing visual cues, voice input, and automation to keep Donald in control without overwhelming him with complexity.
